**Main next steps**
- I need to add my projects page; or it could be a "writing"... not sure

### Bigger things 
- [] I should add a section with my tshirts! I think its such creative low hanging fruit - walking around wearing a 1-of-1 is v cool. 
- [] Make sure 404 is a rick roll!
- [] See if there's a way I can at least partially reincorporate my Faves page again 

### Small things
- [] Make better abstractions for the visual artworks, should have global variables for things like the background colour which I think should be constant and abstracted away unless I explicitly override it within an art work function
- [] Make our CSS global rather than in each art.astro, index.astro, etc. especially for stuff like "header-text"
