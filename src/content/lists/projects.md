## 2024

*[Field of Vision](https://fov.ie/) highlights: real time Aussie Rules Football ball detection at 80% accuracy (world's best to our knowledge), shipped production and certification quality firmware for our devices, built many internal web apps.*

1. **[Substack2Markdown](https://github.com/timf34/Substack2Markdown)** - Download/export free and premium Substack posts, saving them as Markdown files. Also generates HTML interfaces to allow you to browse and sort the markdown files for each author.

2. **[YouTubeSortByLikes](https://github.com/timf34/YouTubeSortByLikes)** - My last project of 2024. A beautiful web app that allows you to sort YouTube videos by likes or like:view ratios, the best signal for quality content imo. [Live site](https://youtube-sort-by-likes.vercel.app/)

3. **[JSONDetective](https://github.com/timf34/JSONDetective)** - CLI tool to automatically finds the schema of a JSON file. Built this to understand the structure of massive JSON files with no schema.

4. **[StainedGlassMap](https://github.com/timf34/StainedGlassMap)** - Mapping the Irish Stained Glass ecosystem! Due an upgrade soon! [Live site](https://stainedglassmap.com/)

5. **[HackIreland](https://github.com/timf34/HackIreland)** - Launched Hack Ireland, our first national hackathon - big, overnight, with an unheard of (within Ireland) €25k cash prize pool. Technically, I designed a pretty cool website. Game of Life, text scrambling subtle encryption effects and suitably *hacker* vibes. [Live site](https://www.hackireland.com/). I also built a [live leaderboard](https://github.com/timf34/HackIrelandLeaderboard) on the day connected to everyone's github repo - so you could see each time someone made a commit - complete with confetti of course. Seeing how active it was at 4.30am made me very happy! [Wayback machine](https://leaderboard.hackireland.com/)

6. **[PrintDirTree](https://github.com/timf34/PrintDirTree)** - CLI tool I use **everyday!** Prints directory tree structure, and also the contents of files for prompting LLMs, with easy exclusions and copying to clipboard.

7. **[BeerBot](https://github.com/timf34/BeerBot)** - Automated script to encourage getting friends to the pub. Specify a time, day of the week, and some pubs, and BeerBot will automatically send a poem to a whatsapp groupchat with instructions to head to a pub.

8. **[Article2Audio](https://github.com/timf34/Article2Audio)** - Paste a URL link, and it'll convert the article to an audio file, which you can download, or sync to your podcast listening app via a personal RSS feed (which it autogenerates). Initially built this in Python, as a personal utility, but there were some strange memory leaks, so I rewrote the backend in Go. [Live site](https://article2audio.com/)

9. **[SubstackGPT - V1](https://github.com/timf34/SubstackGPT)** - Let's you speak to any substack author, using a basic RAG model over their scraped posts. Initial version built in one night.

10. **[EventCountdownRainMeter](https://github.com/timf34/EventCountdownRainMeter)** - Countdown meter for my Windows desktop, a daily reminder of days till deadlines.

11. **[JamesTurrellInspiredArt](https://github.com/timf34/JamesTurrellInspiredArt)** - Replicated James Turrell's circles in various programming languages… however there's more that can be done here! Consider it largely a work in progress.
