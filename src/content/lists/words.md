description: "Words from other languages that capture things English can't"
---

Language is more than just communication; it shapes our perception and observation. There are words in other languages that capture experiences and concepts that English simply doesn't have names for. Here are some of my favourites:

- **Feyli** - *Dhivehi/Maldives* - The feeling of sand between your toes as waves ebb away.

- **Komorebi** - *Japanese* - The dappled sunlight that shines through tree leaves.

- **Hygge** - *Danish* - A profound coziness and contentment drawn from simple pleasures.

- **Saudade** - *Portuguese* - A deep emotional state of nostalgic longing for something or someone that is absent.

- **Waldeinsamkeit** - *German* - The feeling of solitude and connectedness to nature when alone in the woods.

- **Ubuntu** - *Zulu* - "I am because we are" - the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity.

- **Wabi-sabi** - *Japanese* - Finding beauty in imperfection and accepting the natural cycle of growth and decay.

- **Fernweh** - *German* - A longing for far-off places; the opposite of homesickness.

- **Ikigai** - *Japanese* - A reason for being; the thing that gets you up in the morning.

- **Meraki** - *Greek* - Doing something with soul, creativity, or love; putting yourself into your work.
