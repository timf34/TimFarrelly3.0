I think cemeteries are one of the most underrated things to visit when travelling. 

I started visiting them by accident. I was in Athens, trying to outsmart Google Maps after it served me a long looping route around Athens First Cemetery, which I assumed I'd be able to cut through. I walked in trying to save five minutes, and ended up staying a couple hours. 

The entrance opens into this wide space of white marble, lined with mausolea -- these grand house-like tombs, some with delicate sculptures carved into them. The further I walked in, the more beautiful it became. Quietness became its own sound, accented by birdsong. Incredible trees with long purple flowers draping down over the paths, and everywhere these sculptures -- the common motif a person at rest, carved in marble so fine it looks soft.

It was a wonderful time and since then, I've made a habit of visiting cemeteries in new cities. They're almost always beautiful, serene places; and it's quite interesting to see how different countries rest their dead. What I find most interesting is how differently different places do it.

The Woodland Cemetery in Stockholm, Skogskyrkogården, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Stockholm itself is a place where the nature and the city/ modern life really coexist so wonderfully. This is doubly true within its cemetery, which feels like nature's first. You can feel the intense romantic naturalism with the untouched Nordic forest on the site remaining the dominant experience. Footpaths meander freely through a forest, looking to either side you see simple graves laid freely among the pine straw on the floor, almost as if they grew there too, most frequently placed informally, not symmetrically or parallel among one another. 

Then there's Venice's San Michele Cemetery. In spite of Venice's constrained land, they devoted a whole island to resting the dead, just off the main island. Admittedly from the outside it looks like it could be a low-security prison with high walls on all sides, but once you reach there, you realize it is an utterly beautiful sanctuary. In contrast to Stockholm, the whole island feels sculpted and crafted. As you arrive from the water bus, you can walk left to explore the old monastery, or right to see the cemetery which is separated into sections: Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Greek. There's quite a notable hierarchy to the graves at times - there's quite clearly a "wealthy" section housing family mausolea, old and newly designed each with their own architecture. And there's the tightly packed and homogenous looking protestant section - each tombstone essentially identical except for each one having its own unique method of inscription and most with real or plastic flowers. The overall feeling though is that of beauty - everything is designed so well. Even though there's a hierarchy to the graves, each area feels quite special, and all are taken care of. So beautiful the cemetery inspired Arnold Bocklin's Isle of the Dead, which in turn inspired Rachmaninoff' s symphonic poem of the same name. While Stockholm felt like it was a forest with some graves, San Michele feels like a place built to rest the dead, with trees and flowers added for aesthetics and beauty - there's almost always a chapel or other holy building in sight. It very much feels like you're in a special place for resting the dead. 

(I could also put in here a brief paragraph with brief notes on more places. The intensely local cemeteries in Japan's country villages, or the cemeteries in its temples given the land with the best views. Or there's Edinburgh's graveyards scattered through the city. Or the historical figures to be visited in Dublin's x cemetery. Or there's the modern monumental sights like Berlin's WW2 thing... something like this). 

Modern life is unusually good at letting us forget about death. Most of us are lucky enough to live lives where it stays abstract -- something that happens somewhere else, or later, or to someone older. Thank you _progress_ ( hyperlink to https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy)! 

But it can be grounding to be reminded every now and then. Ernest Becker's wrote about how much of civilisation is built around avoiding mortality altogether. And Tolstoy shows how deeply uncomfortable we are even acknowledging death even when its unavoidable. 

A cemetery doesn’t force anything on you. It’s just a quiet walk, some beautiful surroundings, and a gentle reminder that you won’t be here forever -- which is as good a reason as any to enjoy the afternoon.

A little memento mori every now and then is good for the soul.
